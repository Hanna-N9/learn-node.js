//------------------------------------------------------------ Introduction

// Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, or an environment that allows us to execute JavaScript code outside of the browser. A “runtime”
// converts code written in a high-level, human-readable, programming language and compiles it down to code the computer can execute.

//---- (Node.js is already installed) so type node -v in the terminal to check the version of Node

//------------------------------------------------------------ The Node REPL

/* REPL is an abbreviation for read–eval–print loop. It’s a program that loops, or repeatedly cycles, through three different states: 
a read state where the program reads input from a user, the eval state where the program evaluates the user’s input, and 
the print state where the program prints out its evaluation to a console. Then it loops through these states again. */

// Installing Node comes with a built-in JavaScript REPL. To access the REPL is to type the command node into the terminal and hit enter.
//A > character will show up in the terminal, indicating the REPL is running and prompting your input. The Node REPL will evaluate your
// input line by line.
// To type multiple lines and then have them evaluated at once is to type .editor while in the REPL

//--- To do to try out the Node REPL and explore the Node global object

// Type node in the terminal and press enter to enter the Node REPL
