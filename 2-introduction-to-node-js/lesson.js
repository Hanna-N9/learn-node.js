//------------------------------------------------------------ Introduction

// Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, or an environment that allows us to execute JavaScript code outside of the browser. A “runtime”
// converts code written in a high-level, human-readable, programming language and compiles it down to code the computer can execute.

// (Node.js is already installed) so type node -v in the terminal to check the version of Node
