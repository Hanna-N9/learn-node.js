## The Web Server

- The information comes from a web server and is sent to a client so that a user can interact with a website (regarding Front-End). "A <b>web server</b> is a computer process that listens for incoming information requests over the Internet and sends back responses."
  - So, when a user navigates to a website on their browser, the browser makes a request to the website's web server. Every website has at least one web server.
  - When a client makes a single request on a simple website, the web server receives that request and sends the client a response with the specific details to view the website. This is called a static website (akin to a snapshot of the website, where the files remain static and do not change or move). However, a static website falls short, for example, a user navigating social media who wants access to new content as it’s created.
- <b>Protocol:</b> The format of a request and the resulting response.

## What is the Back-end?

The backend in a web application holds the logic to decide which assets to send to the specific user instead of sending the same files to every webpage user. This is known as dynamic content. Dynamic content refers to web content that changes based on various factors, primarily user interactions and preferences. Examples of dynamic content are pages based on user location, emails with automatic name insertion, recommendations based on browsing history, and so on.
