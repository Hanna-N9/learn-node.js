## The Web Server

- The information comes from a web server and is sent to a client so that a user can interact with a website (regarding Front-End). "A <b>web server</b> is a computer process that listens for incoming information requests over the Internet and sends back responses."
  - So, when a user navigates to a website on their browser, the browser makes a request to the website's web server. Every website has at least one web server.
  - When a client makes a single request on a simple website, the web server receives that request and sends the client a response with the specific details to view the website. This is called a static website (akin to a snapshot of the website, where the files remain static and do not change or move). However, a static website falls short, for example, a user navigating social media who wants access to new content as it’s created.
- <b>Protocol:</b> The format of a request and the resulting response.
